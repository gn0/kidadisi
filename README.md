# Kidadisi: an R package for generating XLSForm surveys

Kidadisi is an R package for generating [XLSForm](https://xlsform.org/) surveys.
This is useful because [SurveyCTO](https://www.surveycto.com/) and [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) both support XLSForm as their survey description format.
